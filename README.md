# View-CRISC-actual-exam-questions-answers

I recently cleared my CRISC certification within 1 week of preparation on my first attempt with a score of 930. I hope my experience can help you in your preparation journey.

I took an online course and watched several YouTube videos related to this certification. I also reviewed various FAQs to gain a deeper understanding.

The most significant help in my preparation was practicing exam questions from **Passexam4sure**. I highly recommend them. These tests contain verified answers that help you understand the concepts in depth. they are very similar to the actual exam. I found that around 80% of the questions appeared in my real exam. These **(CRISC practice questions)[https://bit.ly/4faeUx6]** come with detailed explanations for each question, which was invaluable for my preparation. They also offered exam notes which highlight important topics which is also quite helpful.
